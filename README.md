Doodler_iOS
===========

This is a port of my Java real-time networked drawing application I made in college.

It utilizes Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework for the sending/ receiving of data as well as advertising.

This project will be available on the AppStore soon!

**Planned updates**
* Better iPad support
* Redesigned canvas, as in having all clients in a session have the same size drawing canvas
...This will require additional functionality such as pinching to scale the canvas and 2 finger panning
* Undo system 
* Easy access to an  eraser
